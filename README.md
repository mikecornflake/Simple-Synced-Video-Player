# Inspector Mike Video Player

**Inspector Mike Video Player** is a single and multi-channel video
player designed for offshore inspection and ROV operations.

Originally developed to provide synchronised playback of multiple DVR
recordings, IM_Video has evolved into a general-purpose inspection video
player built around the excellent **mpv** media engine.

## Features

- Browse video by folder hierarchy
- Support for MPV-based video playback within the application:
  - Play one to four synchronised video channels simultaneously
  - Synchronous playback controls (Play, Pause, Seek)
  - Automatic layout of multiple video channels
  - Variable speed playback
  - Mouse wheel seek (±3 seconds, ±1 seconds with Ctrl, ±6 seconds 
with Shift)
  - Spacebar pause/resume
  - Frame/image capture
- Multichannel video is currently treated as a set of video files
  in the same folder starting within 10 seconds of each other.
  Awareness of video naming protocols from various subsea
  inspection packages. This allows start date/time to be
  determined.

# FAQ

## Who am I?

This project is developed by Mike Thompson, 
a CSWIP 3.4U Subsea Inspection Engineer and 
former professional Delphi developer who 
regularly works with offshore inspection 
video from multiple contractors.

## Why release this?

Commercial inspection DVR packages often provide 
limited facilities for end clients to review 
multiple synchronised video channels. This 
project aims to make inspection video easier 
to browse, review and analyse, while remaining 
portable and suitable for offshore use.

## Is this free?

Yes.

Just keep the acknowledgements.

## Can I modify it?

Yes.

Please keep the acknowledgements and consider 
offering useful changes back to Mike Thompson, 
URUWorks, or the mpv team, depending on 
which part of the code you modify.
